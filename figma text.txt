Let me start analyzing the data to identify the root cause

Found Validation Rule for zero-usage cycles within the rev_sum_fact_bl dataset.
SELECT insert_dt, 
                     SUM(zero_usage_cycle) AS zero_usage 
FROM(SELECT CAST(hdp_insert_dt_time AS DATE) AS insert_dt, CASE WHEN sms_cnt < 10 AND mms_cnt < 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS zero_usage_cycle 
FROM vz-it-np-gk1v-dev-cwlspr-0.vzw_uda_prd_tbls.rev_sum_fact_bl_adg 
WHERE CAST(hdp_insert_dt_time AS DATE) = CURRENT_DATE -1) 
GROUP BY 1

Deviation confirmed
The deviation confirmed for both SMS & MMS counts on rev_sum_fact_bl as per the historical trend analysis.

🔎
Results: The deviation in sms_cnt < 10 originates from the usg_call_cnt column in the ‘cycle_usage’ table, indicating an issue at this earlier stage.
ii. Checking for MMS Count
✅
Identified the mms_cnt column orginated from usage_col_cnt column from cycle_usage table.
I’m running the count checks for the previous date
...
🔎
Results: The deviation in mms_cnt < 10 originates from the usg_call_cnt column in the ‘cycle_usage’ table, indicating an issue at this earlier stage.
No further upstream tables are involved in the lineage for sms_cnt or mms_cnt. Therefore, the analysis concludes here.
Final Root Cause Summary
usg_call_cnt column in the cycle_usage table values has deviated from it’s historical trend. This directly affected both sms_cnt and mms_cnt in the downstream table (rev_sum_fact_bl).
